Implementation Notes
  
- Program Structure
  
  The program starts from main.c which contains the main function.
  The main function parses all command-line options to initialize
  a swsopt struct defined in sws.h. After a simple verification,
  it invokes function start_server() in net.c to start the http 
  server.
  
  According to the options passed to start_server(), the http server
  runs in different modes. After a request comes in, function request()
  in http_request.c will be invoked to parse the http request header. 
  
  To deal with request URI, if -c is set and the request uri denotes
  a cgi program, the server invokes function call_cgi() in cgi.c to 
  deal with the request. If the request uri represents a directory 
  in the host computer and there doesn't exist a 
  index.html(case-sensitive) in that directory, the server calls 
  send_dirindex() to return a directory indexing html to the client; 
  or, the server calls send_file() to try to send a regular file to 
  the client.
  
  Once the server receives the integrated http request and any error
  happens, it calls send_err_and_exit() to send a error response
  to client and terminate the current process.
  
  After the server deals with the request, either a normal http response
  or error response will be sent. The function send_err_and_exit() is
  used to send a 4XX or 5XX http response. To generate the http response
  header, the function response() in http_response.c is called.

  There are two libraries created to help implement this project, 
  jstring.c and arraylist.c. jstring.c is a C language implementation of
  Java String and StringBuilder. arraylist.c is a liner container which
  is based on an array.
  
- HTTP Request

  HTTP request message is processed as two parts. One is the request
  headers. Another part is the entity-body. Because the entity-body 
  is only the message body sent by client, in our program, we split 
  http request message into two parts before processing.

  In http_request.c file, there are two functions provided to process
  http request headers -- request(3) and clean_request(1). When the
  socket receives the message and splits the message into http request
  headers and message body, it will call request(3) to get information
  from http request headers. This function will fill a structure to
  explain the http request. And the following program can get http
  request information from this structure. (SEE http.h)

  In processing http request header part, the request(3) function will
  check the format problems of each request header. If there is a
  header field or header value not following the rfc1945 syntax,
  request(3) will return bad request error. 

  When processing request-line, the program will get the request-URI
  and decode it. Then save the decoded URI into http_request
  structure. 
  
  When processing request-headers, if the header field is not
  If-Modified-Since, the program will ignore it because those header
  fields are not required in this program. 

  This server can process three different type of data format in the
  request header, but  there is a problem in rfc850 format. Rfc850
  date format uses two digits to represent years. There is no
  explanation of how to process years after 2000. So in our server, we
  define that if the year in rfc850 format is larger than 50, it
  represents 19XX. If the year is less than 50, it represents 20XX.

- HTTP Response

  In our program, we split up response into two parts, one is header
  part, and the other is entity part. Because of the design of our 
  logic, the entity part will be processed in net.c (main routin),
  and net.c will fill up the http_response structure to pass the intersect
  data. You can see the http_response structure in http.h.

  For http_response part, we use the http_response structure to store
  the intersect data and function interfaces. Main routin will pack
  content and fill in the http_response, such as last_modified,
  file_path, http_status, content_length and body_flag. After filling
  the structure, net.c will call response(4) function to go into the
  http_response.

  http_response.c aims to generate a string buffer, which can be
  looked as the response header. First of all, due to the status
  code to determine which header fields should be covered. And
  then go thru different routine to generate it. Finally, copy
  back buffer and change size, which is net.c given to response.

  In details, status line is the first tier of response header
  generation. According to the different status code, header will take
  the different header fields. For example, response header will not
  take content type and length in status 304. And then, if body_flag
  is 1, it means we should take an entity body with the header,
  so we will add a content length (entity body will add in net.c).

  For CGI response, we have a cgi_response(4) to process, and the main
  idea of it is same as response(4). And the body of entity will process
  in net.c.

- CGI
  
  The CGI program must be put in the directory with -c option and 
  must have a filename extension ".cgi"(case-sensitive). 
  
  The CGI uri must start with "/cgi-bin"(case-sensitive) and any 
  characters after first ".cgi" and before "?" is treated as PATH_INFO
  meta variable for CGI request.
  
  If IP address is set with the server start, the SERVER_NAME meta 
  variable is set to that IP address; or, uname(2) is used to provide
  node name as SERVER_NAME.
  
  If CGI program runs more than 60 seconds, it will be killed by the
  server. The time is defined by MAX_CGI_EXEC_TIME in cgi.h.
