- http_response
  
  For http_response part, we use a structure to store the intersect
  data and function interfaces. net.c will pack content and fill in
  the http_response, such as last_modified, file_path, http_status,
  content_length and body_flag. After filling the structure, net.c
  will call response function to go into the http_response.

  http_response.c aims to generate a string buffer, which can be
  looked as the response header. First of all, due to the status
  code to determin which header fields should be covered. And
  then go thru different routin to generate it. Finally, copy
  back buffer and change size, which is net.c given to response.
