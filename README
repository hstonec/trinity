Implementation Notes
  
- Program Structure
  
  The program starts from main.c which contains the main function.
  The main function parses all command-line options to initialize
  a swsopt struct defined in sws.h. After a simple verification,
  it invokes function start_server() in net.c to start the http 
  server.
  
  According to the options passed to start_server(), the http server
  runs in different modes. After a request comes in, function request()
  in http_request.c will be invoked to parse the http request header. 
  
  If -c is set and the request uri denotes a cgi program, the server 
  invokes function call_cgi() in cgi.c to deal with the request. If 
  the request uri represents a directory in the host computer and there
  doesn't exist a index.html(case-sensitive) in that directory, the 
  server calls send_dirindex() to return a directory indexing html 
  to the client; or, the server calls send_file() to try to send a 
  regular file to the client.
  
  After the server deals with the request, either a normal http response
  or error response will be sent. The function send_err_and_exit() is
  used to send a 4XX or 5XX http response. To generate the http response
  header, the function response() in http_response.c is called.

  There are two libraries created to help implement this project, 
  jstring.c and arraylist.c. jstring.c is a C language implementation of
  Java String and StringBuilder. arraylist.c is a liner container which
  is based on an array.
  
- HTTP Request



- HTTP Response
  
  For http_response part, we use a structure to store the intersect
  data and function interfaces. net.c will pack content and fill in
  the http_response, such as last_modified, file_path, http_status,
  content_length and body_flag. After filling the structure, net.c
  will call response function to go into the http_response.

  http_response.c aims to generate a string buffer, which can be
  looked as the response header. First of all, due to the status
  code to determin which header fields should be covered. And
  then go thru different routin to generate it. Finally, copy
  back buffer and change size, which is net.c given to response.
  
- CGI
  
  The CGI program must be put in the directory with -c option and 
  must have a filename extension ".cgi"(case-sensitive).
